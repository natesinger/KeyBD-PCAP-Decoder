# KeyBD-PCAP-Decoder
## Description
Keyboard PCAPs are rather uncommon, but are often used in CTFs. Regardless of the use case, this quick python script can be used on the CLI to decode keyboard captures. It is based on the USB standard which you can find here: https://www.usb.org/sites/default/files/documents/hut1_12v2.pdf (Pg. 53)
## Usage like:
```./decode.py <file.pcap>```
